# FastFingersEquivalent
This is desktop application that can change you web site fast fingers.

I'm planing to make a change for fast finger because it isn't convenietly in all situations. When you are not online you have to use desktop software and I think that this software should have deep setings.

So on the start of project I will just make scelet of my programm that will copy functions of fast fingers but in desctop and after that I'll make deep setings for trening long time or in very hard texts. Maybe for programers text can contains symbols like: ( {}(>,// ), people who don't use this symbols can turn off them, also they can turn on or turn off numbers.

I think I need this program so first of all I make it for myself, but I hope that another people will use it too!
