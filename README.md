# FastFingersEquivalent
This is desktop that can change you web site fast fingers.

I'm planing to make a change for fast finger because it isn't convenietly in all situations. When you are not online you have to use
desctop software and I think that this software should have deep setings.

So on the start of project I will just make scelet of my programm that will copy functions of fast fingers but in desctop and after that
I'll make deep setings for trening long time or in very hard texts. Maybe for programers text can contains symbols like: ( {}(>,// ), 
people who don't use this symbols can turn off it, also they can turn on or turn off.

I think I need this program so first all I make for myself, but I hope that anither people will enjoy it too!
